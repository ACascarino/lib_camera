## Example: Simple timing

This example measures some basic timing information while taking a single frame
(see take picutre example)

### Time measurements:
* T1 == time of a frame (without blank)
* T2 == time doing operations in a line
* T3 == time between frames
* T4 == time between lines 

## Build example
Run the following command: ```make example_timing```
