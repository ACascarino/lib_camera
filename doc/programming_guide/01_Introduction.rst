Overview
---------
The purpose of this programming guide is to provide developers with a comprehensive understanding of the FWK_Camera architecture and guide them on how to effectively interact with camera using xmos devices.

The architecture consists of several key components that work together to facilitate camera communication and data processing. 
These components include:

#. Camera hardware and camera interface
#. Camera drivers
#. User aspplication / user interface
#. Image signal processing
#. I/O
